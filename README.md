This project include-

- **Test Scenarios**: Test scenarios in a test case project are high-level descriptions of functionalities and conditions that need to be tested. They represent real-world use cases of the software application, ensuring that all aspects of the system are validated against expected behavior. Test scenarios help identify key areas of the application to focus on and guide the creation of detailed test cases. They provide a clear overview of what needs to be tested and help ensure comprehensive coverage of the application's features and requirements.

- **Test Plan**: A test plan outlines the overall strategy and methodology for testing a software application or system. It details the objectives, scope, and resources needed for the testing process, serving as a comprehensive guide throughout.

- **Mind Maps**: Mind maps in a test case project are visual representations that help organize and display the various components, dependencies, and relationships within the testing process. They offer a graphical overview of the test cases, scenarios, and their connections.

- **Test Cases**: A test case in a test case project provides a detailed set of instructions and conditions for testing a particular aspect or functionality of a software application. It includes the steps to be executed, expected results, and any necessary preconditions or prerequisites for the test.

- **Bug Report**: A bug report in a test case project is a formal document that details an identified issue or defect in the software. It includes comprehensive information about the problem, steps to reproduce it, observed behavior, and any supporting evidence.

- **Test Summary Report**: A test summary report in a test case project offers a high-level overview of the testing activities and results. It highlights the key findings, metrics, and observations from the testing efforts.

- **Test Metrics**: Test metrics in a test case project are quantitative measurements that provide insights into the effectiveness and progress of the testing process. They help evaluate the quality of the software and offer valuable data for decision-making and process improvement.
